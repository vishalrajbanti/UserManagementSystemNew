## Frameworks and Language Used
- Spring Boot
- Java
- Maven

## Data Flow

### 1. Controller
- Controller handles incoming HTTP requests.
- It defines endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting user information.


### 2. Services
- The services in the Url Hit Counter Application are responsible for encapsulating the business logic and operations related to restaurant management. They serve as an intermediary layer between the controllers (which handle HTTP requests) and the repositories (which interact with the database)

### 3.repository
- The repository in the Url Hit Counter Application project is a crucial component that facilitates the interaction between the application and the database.

## Data Structures Used

In the User Management System, the following data structures are used:




- **userId**: Field to store the id of the User.
- **userName**: Field to store the name of the User.
- **userEmail**: Field to store the Email of the User.
- **userdateOfBirth**: Field to store the dateOfBirth of the User.
- **userphoneNumber**: Field to store the phoneNumber of the User.


## Key Features

The User Management System is designed to provide efficient user management capabilities. Here are the key features of this application:

### 1. User CRUD Operations

- **Add User**: Create new user profiles by providing essential details, including  username,UserId,etc.

- **Get User by UserId**: Retrieve User information by specifying a unique userId.

- **Get All Users**: Retrieve a  all users in the system.

- **Update User Information**: Modify user .

- **Delete Users **: delete users .

### 2. Scalable and Maintainable Architecture

- Utilizes the Spring Boot framework for building robust and scalable applications.

- Follows a well-structured layered architecture, separating concerns between controllers, services, and repositories, ensuring maintainability and testability.



### 3. Customizable and Extendable

- Easily extensible to add more features or attributes to the user profile.


## Project Summary
This project is an User Management System built using Spring Boot. It provides a set of RESTful API endpoints for managing user information, including adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting user records. The project follows a layered architecture with controllers handling HTTP requests, services containing business logic, and a repository for database operations. User data is stored in a database table with attributes restaurantId, restaurantName, Name, restaurantAddress, and restaurantPhoneNumber.
